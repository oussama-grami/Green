Hi, this is Marwen.

Main Updates:
Connection to Carbon Footprint Calculator Backend:

	Connected to the new Carbon Footprint Calculator backend set up by Oussema.
	The backend can be found in the new Con2Back Service.

Media Files Improvement:

	Made improvements to the media files, resulting in smoother and faster platform performance.

Suggestions for Future Developers:

	Left suggestions to maintain and improve the scalability of the project.

Temporary Objects in Components:

	The models created by the previous developer do not match the new backend.
	Used temporary objects in the request bodies found in each component.ts file to accommodate this.

that's it !

Do not forget to run "npm install" before you start working 
Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÉ
